The immune system is a highly networked and complex system, which evolves constantly under the interaction with pathogens. In this study, a high-quality human PPIs network was constructed. Based on this, network properties of the immune system and virus-human interactions were systematically investigated. Additionally, age effect was explored from the view of the host network for immune-related genes and virally-targeted genes during evolution. The unique aspects of SARS-Cov-2 from the view of host network were also studied. Those investigations are helpful for better understanding the composition and evolution of human immune system, and the pathogenesis of viruses.
